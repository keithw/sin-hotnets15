\section{Conclusions}
things greg wants to have covered here or elsewhere:
applications should define their own objectives.

The interface we see to the users is as simple as: how much to spend per day/month, and something that lets people see how much money different applications are spending. If OS enforces reasonable limits, no runaway spending, only applications that can take more than their fair share, which is no different than situation today
