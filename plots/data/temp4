A had benefit -7, cost -14.07, utility -21.07, and best expected utility -21.07
B had benefit -72, cost 0.36, utility -71.64, and best expected utility -71.64

Trial matched srtf, trial was:
[ 0-5: B | 6-12: A | 13-25: D | 26-41: C | 42-71: B ]
finished trial 1 of 1

1 of 1 scenarios matched the srtf result ( 1 )
average delay ratio 1
average flow duration for srtf 30.5
average flow duration for trials 30.5
average number of roundtrips per user 98.5
all users in all trials got best utility they thought they could get
worst srtf divergence was 0
