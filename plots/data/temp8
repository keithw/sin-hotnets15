Trial matched srtf, trial was:
[ 0: F | 1-7: H | 8-27: G | 28-34: A | 35-47: D | 48-63: C | 64-85: E | 86-112: F | 113-148: B ]
finished trial 1 of 1

1 of 1 scenarios matched the srtf result ( 1 )
average delay ratio 1
average flow duration for srtf 53
average flow duration for trials 53
average number of roundtrips per user 188.625
all users in all trials got best utility they thought they could get
worst srtf divergence was 0
