running 1 trials with 2 users and start time die size 40 and start time die size 40...
trial shorthand= 6:7, 0:36

User: A flow start time: 6 num packets: 7
User: B flow start time: 0 num packets: 36

A had benefit -7, cost -14.07, utility -21.07, and best expected utility -21.07
B had benefit -43, cost -28.93, utility -71.93, and best expected utility -71.93

Sum user utility was -93 while sum of best expected utilties was -93 (let down of 0)

market required 137 round trips
User: A had flow duration 7 in simulated schedule
User: B had flow duration 43 in simulated schedule
User: A had flow duration 7 in srtf schedule
User: B had flow duration 43 in srtf schedule
Trial matched srtf, trial was:
[ 0-5: B | 6-12: A | 13-42: B ]
finished trial 1 of 1

1 of 1 scenarios matched the srtf result ( 1 )
average delay ratio 1
average flow duration for srtf 25
average flow duration for trials 25
average number of roundtrips per user 68.5
all users in all trials got best utility they thought they could get
worst srtf divergence was 0
