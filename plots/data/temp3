running 1 trials with 3 users and start time die size 40 and start time die size 40...
trial shorthand= 6:7, 0:36, 16:16

User: A flow start time: 6 num packets: 7
User: B flow start time: 0 num packets: 36
User: C flow start time: 16 num packets: 16

A had benefit -7, cost -14.07, utility -21.07, and best expected utility -21.07
B had benefit -59, cost -12.77, utility -71.77, and best expected utility -71.77
C had benefit -16, cost -32.16, utility -48.16, and best expected utility -48.16

Sum user utility was -141 while sum of best expected utilties was -141 (let down of 0)
