\subsection*{Abstract}
We argue that computer networks should be made ``self-incentivizing'':
designed so that anybody may contribute incremental capacity and be
rewarded for it. In such a scheme, endpoints express their demand in
terms of a price, not just for ``bandwidth,'' but effectively by
bidding on each packet they want transmitted. This creates a market
incentive to build out capacity where the network needs it most and 
for that network to better serve the needs of its users.

Our position is that this kind of mechanism---one where ``paid
prioritization'' is celebrated instead of banned, and anybody may be an
ISP-for-a-day---is the missing piece necessary to revive
almost-successful systems of the recent past, such as urban mesh
networks, and foster more innovation and growth in last-mile Internet service.

Could such a system actually work? We evaluated, in simulation, the
stability and performance of a simple market-based congestion-control and queue-management
policy. In these experiments, users bid for
transmission opportunities in a logically centralized order book and
resell them to one another. In a model where users behave ``nicely,''
this distributed-bidding scheme was sufficient to realize schedules
that closely approximated the shortest-remaining-time-first
schedule.
