\subsection*{Abstract}
We argue that computer networks should be made ``self-incentivizing'':
designed so that anybody may contribute incremental capacity and be
rewarded for it. In such a scheme, endpoints express their demand in
terms of a price, not just for ``bandwidth,'' but effectively by
bidding on each packet they want transmitted. This creates a market
incentive to build out capacity where the network needs it.

Our position is that this kind of mechanism---one where ``paid
priorization'' is celebrated instead of banned, and anybody may be an
ISP-for-a-day---is the missing piece necessary to revive
almost-successful systems of the recent past, such as urban mesh
networks, and foster more innovation and growth in last-mile Internet service.

Would such a system actually work? We evaluated, in simulation, the
stability and performance of a simple market-based congestion-control and queue-management
policy. In these experiments, users bid for
transmission opportunities in a logically-centralized order book and
resell them to one another. In a model where users behave ``nicely,''
this distributed-bidding scheme was sufficient to realize schedules
that closely approximated the shortest-remaining-time-first
schedule. We then describe a multiresolution market that aims
to work in the presence of strategic bidders and users with
differing utility functions.
