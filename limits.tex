\section{Limitations and future work}
\label{sec:limits}
Our current implementation is a start to a much larger project. While we cover initial market designs and simulate the interactions between one potential type of user, a large body of work remains untouched.
Users of a self-incentivized network will need to compensate each other and verify that they recieved the guarutees they paid to secure.
A successful self-incentivized netowork would also need to worry about the security and integrity of packet transmission and payment. Fraudulent capacity providers and extorting users would certainly appear in an implementation with real money involved.

We believe elegant solutions exist to facilitate paying for transmission over multiple hops and that it is possible to allocate download capacity with a market, but we leave also leave concreate solutions to those problems to future work.
